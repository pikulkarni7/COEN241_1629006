5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions? (4 pts)
	Arguments can be passed alongwith faas-cli or curl commands while invoking a deployed function.
	
	Below are examples where arguments are passed to the functions:
	curl -d ‘{“Sample”: “Argument”}’ http://127.0.0.1:8080/function/slack-interactive
	
	echo “Sample Argument” | faas-cli invoke figlet

6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs? (4 pts)

We can use various Python libraries to translate a given string into a desired type. For example, urllib can be used to translate a string into a URL. json.loads() can be used to translate a JSON string to a Python 
dict. This way, we can modify the input into a desired argument type for our function.
